## Counting value of sold pizzas
```sql
SELECT od.pizza_id,
       od.quantity,
       p.price,
       od.quantity * p.price AS sales_value
FROM orderdetails od 
LEFT JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id;

	1. Conceptualize the dataset
		a. Identify grain, measures and dimensions
		b. Identify critical vs. Non critical columns
		c. Understand definitions

Dataset includes information about orders made in 2015
Four tables:
 - Order details - includes 48.620 rows and four columns:
     - Order_details_ID - primary key, serial number
     - Order_ID - foreign key (reference to OrdersTable)
     - Pizza_ID - foreign key (reference to PizzasTable)
     - Quantity - number of ordered pizzas 
 - Orders - includes 21.350 rows and three columns:
     - Order_ID - primary key, serial number
     - Date - date when order was placed
     - Time - time when order was placed
 - Pizza types - includes 33 rows and four columns:
     - Pizza_type_ID - primary key, created based on the pizza name
     - Name - list of all pizzas in the menu
     - Category - pizzas' categories (chicken, classic, supreme, veggie)
     - Ingredients - list of ingredients for each pizza
 - Pizzas - includes 97 rows and four columns:
     - Pizza_ID - primary key, created based on combination of Pizza_type_ID and Size
     - Pizza_type_ID - foreign key (reference to PizzaTypesTable)
     - Size - pizza size (S/M/L/XL/XXL)
     - Price - each pizza price in USD based on the pizza type and pizza size
Tables are complete, there is no missing or invalid information in the dataset.
I created database through PgAdmin, created tables and imported all files (CSV) .
--

	2. Locate solvable issues 
		a. Solvalbe
			i. Formatting (daty, czas, itp. Formatowanie) - I created tables in PgAdmin, formatting is correct and in CSV files it was also correct)
			ii. Consisciency (np. US --> USA wszÄ™dzie)  - data in all tables in consistent
			iii. Duplicates - there are no duplicates
	4. Evaluate unsolvable - N/D
			i. Missing values
			ii. Non logical dates
			iii. Unexisting for example countries

 
	5. Augmentation - calendar table to add in PowerBI
		a. Dodawanie np. kolumn albo dodatkowych tabel
