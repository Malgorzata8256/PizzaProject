	1. Conceptualize the dataset
		a. Identify grain, measures and dimensions
		b. Identify critical vs. Non critical columns
		c. Understand definitions

Dataset includes information about orders made in 2015
Four tables:
 - Order details - includes 48.620 rows and four columns:
     - Order_details_ID - primary key, serial number
     - Order_ID - foreign key (reference to OrdersTable)
     - Pizza_ID - foreign key (reference to PizzasTable)
     - Quantity - number of ordered pizzas 
 - Orders - includes 21.350 rows and three columns:
     - Order_ID - primary key, serial number
     - Date - date when order was placed
     - Time - time when order was placed
 - Pizza types - includes 33 rows and four columns:
     - Pizza_type_ID - primary key, created based on the pizza name
     - Name - list of all pizzas in the menu
     - Category - pizzas' categories (chicken, classic, supreme, veggie)
     - Ingredients - list of ingredients for each pizza
 - Pizzas - includes 97 rows and four columns:
     - Pizza_ID - primary key, created based on combination of Pizza_type_ID and Size
     - Pizza_type_ID - foreign key (reference to PizzaTypesTable)
     - Size - pizza size (S/M/L/XL/XXL)
     - Price - each pizza price in USD based on the pizza type and pizza size
Tables are complete, there is no missing or invalid information in the dataset.
I created database through PgAdmin, created tables and imported all files (CSV) .
--

	2. Locate solvable issues 
		a. Solvalbe
			i. Formatting (daty, czas, itp. Formatowanie) - I created tables in PgAdmin, formatting is correct and in CSV files it was also correct)
			ii. Consisciency (np. US --> USA wszÄ™dzie)  - data in all tables in consistent
			iii. Duplicates - there are no duplicates
	4. Evaluate unsolvable - N/D
			i. Missing values
			ii. Non logical dates
			iii. Unexisting for example countries

 
	5. Augmentation - calendar table to add in PowerBI
		a. Dodawanie np. kolumn albo dodatkowych tabel

## Creating tables in PgAdmin
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders
		(
order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY	,
-- Unique identifier for each order placed by a table
date	DATE,
-- Date the order was placed (entered into the system prior to cooking & serving)
time TIME
-- Time the order was placed (entered into the system prior to cooking & serving)
		);
CREATE TABLE PizzaTypes
		(
pizza_type_id	VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
-- Unique identifier for each pizza type
name	VARCHAR(50),
-- Name of the pizza as shown in the menu
category VARCHAR(50)	,
-- Category that the pizza fall under in the menu (Classic, Chicken, Supreme, or Veggie)
ingredients VARCHAR(150)
-- Comma-delimited ingredients used in the pizza as shown in the menu (they all include Mozzarella Cheese, even if not specified  and they all include Tomato Sauce, unless another sauce is specified)
		);
CREATE TABLE Pizzas
		(
pizza_id	VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
-- Unique identifier for each pizza (constituted by its type and size)
pizza_type_id	VARCHAR(50),
-- Foreign key that ties each pizza to its broader pizza type
size VARCHAR(50),
-- Size of the pizza (Small, Medium, Large, X Large, or XX Large)
price DECIMAL,
-- Price of the pizza in USD
FOREIGN KEY (pizza_type_id) REFERENCES PizzaTypes(pizza_type_id)
		);
CREATE TABLE OrderDetails 
		(
order_details_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY	,
-- Unique identifier for each pizza placed within each order (pizzas of the same type and size are kept in the same row, and the quantity increases)
order_id	INTEGER,
-- Foreign key that ties the details in each order to the order itself
pizza_id	VARCHAR(50),
-- Foreign key that ties the pizza ordered to its details, like size and price
quantity INTEGER,
-- Quantity ordered for each pizza of the same type and size
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
FOREIGN KEY (pizza_id) REFERENCES Pizzas(pizza_id) 
		);

SQL Queries

## counting value of sold pizzas
```sql
SELECT od.pizza_id,
       od.quantity,
       p.price,
       od.quantity * p.price AS sales_value
FROM orderdetails od INNER JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id;
```

## verification which pizza size is the most popular (by number of order units) and % share
```sql

SELECT p.size,
       SUM(od.quantity) AS pizza_by_size,
       ROUND(SUM(od.quantity) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(od.quantity)) OVER (),2) AS percentage_share_by_size
